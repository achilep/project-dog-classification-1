Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

**Where to get the data:**

Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/dogImages`.  The `dogImages/` folder should contain 133 folders, each corresponding to a different dog breed.

Download the [human dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/lfw`.  If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the folder. 

**How do we do it?** 

The most important step in building networks and getting answers is knowing what you're doing. As we become comfortable building and coding, we tend to do a lot of copy-pasting of various fragments of the code, this may not be bad but if this your default mode then it's a big red flag. So, in the spirit of understanding our networks, let's start with the most important building block - <b> the data. </b> What are we working with? <br>
